Upon opening the page, the computer will pick a number and keep it hidden. The user then selects letters on their keyboard and the application tests to see if the letter matches or not. There are eight tries available and if the users selects the match, the wins category increases. If not, the losses category increases. Keep playing until you match the computer!
